# Horiseon Marketing Accessibility

## Description

This project helped address the accessibitly and SEO problems Horiseon were having with their website. To start this project I was provided with starter HTML and CSS code, which I have edited to create the final project. 
In order to be more accessible and improve the website's SEO semnatic HTML elements were distinguished in the code as well as the addition of 'alt' text to describe the images and icons used on the webpage. To figure out the elements that needed to be changed, I looked back at the week 1 materials provided and identified the areas where amendments were necessary.

This project has higlighted the importance of using semantic tags in the HTML code to ensure the web content is accessbile as well as ensuring all images have alternative text to further enhance the accessibility.
